# Data Structures Review
Just my personal Data Structures Review... I need to try to remember some few key concepts, so I'll be re-implementing some algorithms and playing around with diferent structures.

This may also be interesting for future notes if I need to remember something (again) or something like that.

I'll be making this public so if anybody out there need or would like to so these implementations (and accidentally skipped the first few thousand pages of the search result). However, don't take it as an official answer for whatever questions you may have. I'll be doing mostly from memory and probably with a help of Cormen's book, so the algorithm itself (or data structure) may (and probably will) vary from official pseudocodes out there...
